# tensor-network

Tensor-Network Simulations for Quantum Chemistry (Julia + iTensors)
Overview
This project explores tensor-network methods (primarily MPS/DMRG) for quantum chemistry using [ITensors.jl] and Julia notebooks (.ipynb). The goal is to prototype, benchmark, and document small-to-medium electronic structure problems with chemically meaningful takeaways (accuracy vs. cost, entanglement patterns, and best practices).

Tech Stack
Language: Julia (1.x)

Core library: ITensors.jl

Notebooks: Jupyter / IJulia

Optional helpers: Plots.jl, BSON.jl (checkpoints), DrWatson.jl (project organization)
